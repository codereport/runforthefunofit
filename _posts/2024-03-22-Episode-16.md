**About the Guest**

[Romain](https://www.instagram.com/zoom.zoom.romy) [Carette](https://www.strava.com/athletes/12204112) is a French runner who has been living in Toronto (Canada, ON) and working for Stinson Design since June 2021. He will turn 35 in 2025, the year he plans to complete this incredible challenge. He started running in 2010 and ran his first marathon in 2015. He fell in love with the distance, over which I recently smashed my personal best in 2h22min37sec in Valencia (Spain).
