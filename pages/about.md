Conor (he/him) started recreationally running back in university (~2010). When he graduated, he played soccer 1-3 times a week and supplemented that with 100-150km a month of running. During the pandemic, he started to increase his mileage up to 400-450km a month and decided to join a run club, [BlackToe](https://www.instagram.com/blacktoerunning/), in September of 2021. Since then, he has drastically improved all of the race times (5k, 10k and Half Marathon). Professionally, he is a [Research Scientist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conorhoekstra/) at NVIDIA working on array programming models and languages.
